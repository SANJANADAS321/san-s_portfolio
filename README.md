  # Data Cleaning/Preparation:
  The following task was performed in the initial data preparation phase
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Handling missing values
  - Data cleaning and formatting

  # Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - What is the overall sales trend?
  - What will be the estimated sales for Jan 2025
 
  # Data Analysis:
  - The trendline equation (e.g. y=1200x + 10000) helps forecast future sales.
  - Using FORECAST function to predict future sales:
    =FORECAST(37, B2:B37 , A2:A37)
    This estimates sales for Jan 2025 based on the trend.
